title: "Strings"

Characters are not that useful in isolation.
Instead, we often need to group characters into a sequence.
And in programming, we call such a sequence of characters "string".

Due to their use in almost all applications, almost all programming languages provide support for strings.
And the C++ programming language provide a sofisticated `std::string` standard library type.

The fact that string is a standard library type rather than a primitive does have implications.
To use the `std::string` in our code, we need to `#include` the approprate header:

```cpp
#include <string>
```

## String Operations

For the most part,
you can use `std::string` much like the fundamental types such as `int` and `double`.
You can, for example, declare a `std::string` variable and initialize it with an initial value.
When you create a string, you often specify its initial value as a *string literal*, 
which is enclosed by double quotes in C++:

```cpp
const std::string alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
```

### Query size of a string

If you try to perform more complicated opeartions with string,
you will find that its usage is not exactly the same as those fundamental types.
One of the big differences is the function call syntax.
For example, it is a common operation to query the length of a string,
and you probably expect a function like this:

TODO: bug icon
```cpp
const auto chars_count = std::string_length(s);
```

As the bug icon emphasized, the code above is incorrect in C++.
TODO: an explaination of *member functions*

```cpp
const auto chars_count = s.size();
```

<Info>

You will notice that I use the `auto` keyword here rather than an `int`.
That is because that the return type of `s.size()` is `std::string::size_type`,
which is an alias defined as `std::size_t`.
You need to write `std::size_t` if you want to be explicit about the type of `chars_count`.

```cpp
-const auto chars_count = s.size();
+const std::size_t chars_count = s.size();
```

</Info>

### Concatenation

Another common operations of strings is concatenation,
which is accompalished by operators `+` and `+=`.

```cpp

```

### Select character from a string

### String assignment

### Extracting part of a string

### Searching within a string

## Numeric conversions

## C-style strings

In the early years, a large portion of C++'s success can be attribute to its ability to use C code directly.
As a result, C++ inherits almost all the features in C, including C's way of handling string.
C-style string are low-level array of characters.
And it lack the convinience of string manipulation that `std::string` possess.

Having multiple string types certainly increases the conceptural complexity of C++ and makes it harder to learn.
Nevertheless, the C compatibility requirement of C++ design means C++ must support multiple styles of string.
Consequently, having an understanding of C-style strings is still important in C++.

String literals, for example, has the type of an array of characters.
And you cannot use operations for `std::string`, such as `+`, for string literals:

todo: bug icon
```cpp
const std::string s = "Hello, " + "world";
```

To circumvent this limitation, you need to explicitly convert `"Hello, "` to a `std::string`:

```cpp
const std::string s = std::string{"Hello, "} + "world";
```

Another problem that arise is when certain libraries require the usage of C-style strings.
If you use those libraries with `std::string`,
at some point you need to convert the string representation to its C-style string counterpart.
Fortunately, `std::string` provides an `c_str` member function to perform this task for you.
