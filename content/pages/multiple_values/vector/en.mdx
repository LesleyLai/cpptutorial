## Declaring a vector
One of the design principles for C++ containers is that they behave similarly to fundamental types.
Thus, just as you can declare an integer value as
```cpp
int x;
```
you can declare a vector as
```cpp
std::vector<int> vec;
```
This declaration introduces a new variable `vec`,
which is a vector of integers as the type parameter suggests.

## Manipulating a vector
When you declare a vector as above, it start out empty.
Since empty vectors are not particularly useful,
the first thing we will learn is how to add elements to a vector object.

When you declare a vector as above, it starts empty.
Since empty vectors are not particularly useful,
the first thing you will learn is how to add elements to a vector object.
The usual approach is to invoke the `push_back` member function,
which adds new elements to the end of a vector (thus the name `push_back`).

For example, if `vec` is an empty vector of integers as declared above,
executing code

```cpp
vec.push_back(1);
vec.push_back(1);
vec.push_back(2);
```

changes `vec` to a three elements vector that contains the sequence `1`, `1`, and `2`.

The size of a vector is not fixed, which means you can continue to add elements to it:
```cpp
vec.push_back(3);
vec.push_back(5);
```

And now our vector will contain `1`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `5`.

TODO: `pop_back`

Just like `std::string`, to select and modify elements in a vector, we use the `[]` opeartor.
For example, 
```cpp
vec[1] = vec[2];
```
sets the value at index 1 from `1` to the value at index 2 (`2`).

## Selecting elements from a vector

The `[]` opeartor does not check whether the index you provide is valid.
Using `[]` with a wrong index causes undefined behavior:

TODO: bug icon
```cpp
vec[6] = 8; // undefined behavior
```

The operation of testing whether an index is valid is called *bounds checking*.
To access vectors with bound-checking, we can use the `at` member function:
```cpp
vec.at(6) = 8; // The program reports out-of-bound access
```

## Creating a vector of a predefined size

## Other constructors of vector

Creating an empty vector and then pushing several elements into it is cumbersome.
Because it is such a common operation,
`std::vector` provides us a convenient way to initialize a vector with a sequence of values at once:
```cpp
std::vector<int> vec {1, 1, 2, 3, 5};
```
