title: "Handle Multiple Values"
---

Up until now, most of the programming examples you have seen manipulate single numerical values.
Nevertheless, as it is said, "where there is one, there are many."
In a lot of situations, we need to handle collections of data.

This chapter introduces some of the most commonly used types in C++, the `string`, `vector`, and `array`.
A `string` is a convenient abstraction over a sequence of characters.
And `vector` and `array` represent a generic sequence of things.
Having those types in your toolbox will make your life much easier to write interesting applications.
