title: "Structures"
---

A structure is the primary way in C++ to introduce user-defined type.

The definition of a structure is straightforward.
We use `struct` keyword, give the struct a name, and put the body of the structure inside.
In the following case, we created a struct for a 2-dimensional point.

```cpp
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};
```

<Info>

Notice the last semicolon in the above code.
Adding a semicolon to the end of a structure definition is required in C++.

</Info>

We create a structure variable just like how we create variables for fundamental types:

```cpp
Point p;
// p = {???, ???}
```

# The dot syntax

Similar to variables of fundamental types, this structure is *uninitialized*.
Structure initialization is a surprisingly complex topic,
and we will discuss them more in-depth later.
For now, we can initialize each individual *data members* of this structure by using the dot syntax:

<Info>

Sometimes data members are colloquially called *fields*.
This book uses the two terms interchangeably.

</Info>

```cpp
Point p;
+p.x = 0;
+p.y = 0;
// p = {0, 0}
```

Now the point `p` is initialized with both `x` and `y` data members set to `0`.

We can use the dot syntax to *mutate* the structure further:

```cpp
Point p;
p.x = 0;
p.y = 0;
// p = {0, 0}
+p.x = 42;
+p.y = 55;
// p = {42, 55}
```

# Structure initialization

Having uninitialized variables is an undesirable situation.
And there are several ways where we can make the above code a little bit better.

First, it is possible to initialize data members in the structure by the `=` syntax:

```cpp
struct Point {
+    int x = 0;
+    int y = 0;
};

Point p;
// p = {0, 0}
```

## Aggregate initialization

What if we don't want the defaulted values of data members that we put in the structure definition?
We can still explicitly modify our point `p` by the dot syntax after initialization.
But a better way is to use the language *aggregate initialization* facility:

```cpp
Point p {42, 55};
// p = {42, 55}
```

<Info>

In the C programming language,
the aggregate initialization syntax contains an additional `=` sign:

```cpp
Point p = {42, 55};
```

This syntax still works in C++ and is equivalent to the code above.

</Info>

You don't need to initialize all data members in the aggregate initialization.
In this case the remaining fields get *value initialized*:

```cpp
Point p1 {42};
// Ok, p1.y is value initialization to zero
// p1 = {42, 0}
Point p2 {};
// Ok, both fields of p2 is value initialization to zero
// p2 = {0, 0}
```

This value initialization behavior can be especially useful when the structure definition does not provide a default value for data members,
which is common in existing C code:

```cpp
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

Point bad_point; // bad_point = {???, ???}
Point good_point {}; // good_point = {0, 0}
```

## Designated initializers

If you want to initialize the data members with explicit fields names,
you can use *designated initializers*:

```cpp
Point p {.x = 42, .y = 55};
// p = {42, 55}
```

<Info>

Designated initializer is a feature added in C++20,
so make sure to enable C++20 in your compiler options.

</Info>

In designated initializer, each *designator* must name a data member of our structure.
We can omit some data members,
and in this case, those data members get *value-initialized* to a default value.

```cpp
Point p {.y = 55};
// Ok, p.x = 0
```

On the other hand, unlike the C language counterpart, 
all designators in the C++ designated initializer must appear in the same order as the data members.

```cpp
Point p {.y = 55, .x = 42};
// Error
```

## Structures and functions

We use structures in the same way as using fundamental types.
For example, we can create functions that take and return structures.
Below are some functions that might be useful for our `Point`:

Below is a function that moves a point by `dx` alone the x-axis and `dy` alone the y-axis.
It returns a new point as an result and does not change the original point.

```cpp
auto point_translate(Point p, int dx, int dy) -> Point
{
  return Point {.x = p.x + dx, .y = p.y + dy};
}
```
