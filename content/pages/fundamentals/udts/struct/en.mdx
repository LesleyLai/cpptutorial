title: "Struct"
---

A `struct` is the primary way in C++ to introduce user-defined type.

The definition of a struct type is straightforward.
We use `struct` keyword, give the struct a name, and put the body of the structure inside.
In the following case, we created a struct for a 2-dimensional point.

```cpp
struct Point2 {
    int x;
    int y;
};
```

<Info>

Notice the last semicolon in the above code.
Adding a semicolon to the end of a struct definition is required in C++.

</Info>

We create a struct variable just like how we create variables for fundamental types:

```cpp
Point2 p;
// p = {???, ???}
```

# The dot syntax

Similar to variables of fundamental types, this struct is *uninitialized*.
Struct initialization is a surprisingly complex topic,
and we will discuss them more in-depth later.
For now, we can initialize each individual *data members* of this struct by using the dot syntax:

<Info>

Sometimes data members are colloquially called *fields*.
This book uses the two terms interchangeably.

</Info>

```cpp
Point2 p;
+p.x = 0;
+p.y = 0;
// p = {0, 0}
```

Now the point `p` is initialized with both `x` and `y` data members set to `0`.

We can use the dot syntax to *mutate* the struct further:

```cpp
Point2 p;
p.x = 0;
p.y = 0;
// p = {0, 0}
+p.x = 42;
+p.y = 55;
// p = {42, 55}
```

# `struct` initialization

Having uninitialized variables is an undesirable situation.
And there are several ways where we can make the above code a little bit better.

First, it is possible to initialize data members in the struct by the `=` syntax:

```cpp
struct Point2 {
+    int x = 0;
+    int y = 0;
};

Point2 p;
// p = {0, 0}
```

## Aggregate initialization

What if we don't want the defaulted values of data members that we put in the struct definition?
We can still explicitly modify our point `p` by the dot syntax after initialization.
But a better way is to use the language *aggregate initialization* facility:

```cpp
Point p {42, 55};
// p = {42, 55}
```

<Info>

In the C programming language,
the aggregate initialization syntax contains an additional `=` sign:

```cpp
Point p = {42, 55};
```

This syntax still works in C++ and is equivalent to the code above.

</Info>

You don't need to initialize all data members in the aggregate initialization.
In this case the remaining fields get *value initialized*:

```cpp
Point p1 {42};
// Ok, p1.y is value initialization to zero
// p1 = {42, 0}
Point p2 {};
// Ok, both fields of p2 is value initialization to zero
// p2 = {0, 0}
```

This value initialization behavior can be especially useful when the struct definition does not provide a default value for data members,
which is common in existing C code:

```cpp
struct Point2 {
    int x;
    int y;
};

Point2 bad_point; // bad_point = {???, ???}
Point2 good_point {}; // good_point = {0, 0}
```

## Designated initializers

If you want to initialize the data members with explicit fields names,
you can use *designated initializers*:

```cpp
Point p {.x = 42, .y = 55};
// p = {42, 55}
```

<Info>

Designated initializer is a feature added in C++20,
so make sure to enable C++20 in your compiler options.

</Info>

In designated initializer, each *designator* must name a data member of our struct.
We can omit some data members,
and in this case, those data members get *value-initialized* to a default value.

```cpp
Point p {.y = 55};
// Ok, p.x = 0
```

On the other hand, unlike the C language counterpart, 
all designators in the C++ designated initializer must appear in the same order as the data members.

```cpp
Point p {.y = 55, .x = 42};
// Error
```
