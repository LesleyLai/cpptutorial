title: "Access Control, Constructors, and Classes"

```cpp
struct Temperature {
    double kelvin = 0;
};
```

Breaking:

```cpp
Temperature t;
t.kelvin = -1; // oops
```

## Access Control

```cpp
struct Temperature {
private:
    double kelvin_ = 0;
public:
    auto kelvin() const -> double {
        return kelvin_;
    }

    void set_kelvin(double new_kelvin) {
        if (new_kelvin < 0) new_kelvin = 0;
        kelvin_ = new_kelvin;
    }
};
```

## Constructors

## Keyword `class`

C++ actually has another keyword for user defined types, `class`.
Unlike a lot of other programming languages, `struct` and `class` creates the same kind of types.
They can both have constructors, and access control specifiers.
The only difference is that in `class`,
visibility of every members is `private` by default.

For example: TODO

`struct` and `class` can always be used interchangably with minor modification.
However they do communicate meaning to humans.
I prefer to use the `struct` keyword on data with no business logic and invariant,
and to use `class` on more complicated types.
