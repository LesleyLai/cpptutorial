title: "Containers"

**Containers**, also called *collections* in some other programming languages,
are data structures that contains a group of objects.

We haven't talk about any containers yet,
but the simplest one in C++ is the static contiguous array.
To use array, we need to include the `<array>` header.
For example,

```cpp
#include <array>

std::array arr {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

creates an integer array with size 5.

## Looping Through a Container with ranged `for` loop

#### What is containers

We could use while/for

Error prone/indexing

A more concise way to iterate through the array is the *range-based for loop*.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

auto main() -> int {
  std::array arr {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

  for (auto elem: arr) {
    std::cout << elem << '\n';
  }
}
```
