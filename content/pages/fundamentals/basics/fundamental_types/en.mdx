title: "Fundamental Types"
---

There are several **fundamental types** (also sometimes called *builtin-types*) built into the C++ compiler.
TODO: more tips

Contrase to
`struct` `class` and `union`

## Fundamental Types

### The Integer types

`int`

#### Integer Overflow

### The Floating-Point Types

### The Boolean Type



## Casting

TODO
Narrowing/widening

- Compilers implicit convert types (sometimes with warning)
- Casting make it explicit
- This can backfire

C++ has a set of casts, ... TODO
They are intentionally designed to be long and ugly because the language designer's distaste of cast.

Those casts are safer than the "parentheses cast" and make the semantics of cast clear.

<Info>

With "parentheses cast", it is not clear if you mean a type conversion function or bit reintepretation.
`static_cast` always means former, and `std::bit_cast` always means later.

</Info>

The rule is simple, use cast only when nessesory, and never use "parentheses cast."

TODO: cast can means "I am Ok with information loss"

## Value Semantics

Primitive vs. Reference Data Types
"Do as the ints do"
