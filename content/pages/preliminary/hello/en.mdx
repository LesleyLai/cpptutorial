Let's look at some simple C++ code.
Below is a C++ program that prints `"Hello world!\n"` to the standard output.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto main() -> int {
  std::cout << "Hello world!\n";
}
```

<Info>

This tutorial provides some documentation for certain terminologies and standard library facilities.
They are always marked by an underscore.
You can hover over `<iostream>` or `cout` in the above snippet to see it in action.

Try to copy, compile, and run this code in your local environment.
If you haven't set up your local environment yet, use [godbolt.org](https://godbolt.org/) (you need to enable "Output -> Run the compiled output" option).

If everything is set up correctly, you should expect that the program prints

```txt
Hello world!
```

and returns `0`.

This program already composed some fundamental concepts in C++. Donâ€™t be overwhelmed as we will take a look at the code line by line.

**`#include`**

`#include` is a preprocessor instruction that includes other C++ source files into our current source file.
In the "hello world" example, we `#include` the file `<iostream>`.
`<iostream>` is the C++ input/output library,
and it contains the standard library facilities such as `std::cout`.

**`auto main() -> int`**

C++ has one unique entry point called the `main()` function,
and every C++ program starts to execute from here.

The syntax `auto f() -> int` means we **declare** a function `f` that takes no arguments and returns `int`.
`main()` is special because despite it returns an integer, you do not need to specify a return value; it returns `0` by default.
The integer returns by main indicates the **exit state** of the program; a value of `0` means no error.
Returning any numbers other than `0` tells the operating system that something is wrong when executing the program.
For example:

```cpp notip=true
auto main() -> int {
  if (something_is_wrong()) {
    return 42;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}
```

The version of `main()` function showed above uses **trailing return type** syntax, and this tutorial will use it consistently.
This trailing return type version is equivalent to the following version:

```cpp notip=true
#include <iostream>

-auto main() -> int {
+int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello world!\n";
}
```

The usage of the trailing return type is mainly for a stylish reason, but there are cases where you must use the trailing return type.

** `{...}` **

The curly braces `{` and `}` indicate the begin and end of the `main()` function.
The pair of curly braces with function body following the function declaration turns it into a **function definition**.

**`std::cout << "Hello world!\n";`**

`std::cout` outputs the string `"hello world!\n"` to the **standard output**.
The `\n` character at the end of string is the end line character.

As for `std`, it is a **namespace**, and all the symbols of the C++ standard library are declared in `std`.
To call a standard library function, you need to *qualify* your function call with the namespace `std`.
We will talk about namespace in detail in later chapters.
