title: "Install a C++ compiler"
---

C++ programs are usually composing from *sources files*.
To run such program, you need a *compiler* that compiles those sources files into object files.
And object files are linked together by a *linker* to create an executable file or a library.

Compilers and linkers are usually distributed together as a toolchain,
so you only need to install one package.
As currently, there are three major compiler toolchains that you can choose:
- Microsoft Visual C++ (As part of Microsoft visual studio, Windows only)
- g++ (Part of GCC)
- clang++ (Part of the llvm project)

# Install a compiler

The following instruction shows how to install a compiler on Windows, Linux, or MacOS.

<Info>

### About Outdated Compilers

This tutorial expects a relatively recent version of a C++ compiler.
If you have GCC 8 or earlier, Clang 8 or earlier, or Visual Studio 2019 16.7 or earlier,
it would be best to upgrade your toolchain to a newer version.

## Windows

On Windows, we will install Microsoft Visual Studio.
You can find a link to download the latest Visual Studio Community edition at [visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
When installing, be sure to enable the C++ support option.
If you already have a Visual Studio installed without C++ support,
you can still use the Visual Studio Installer to add C++ toolchain.
TODO: Check version

## Linux

On Linux, use your package manager to install either GCC or Clang.
The usage two tools are mostly compatible,
so I will use GCC as an example.

For example, on Ubuntu, you can run the following line in the terminal:

```sh
$ sudo apt install build-essential
```

The `build-essential` package contains `gcc`, `g++` and a bunch of other build tools.
If you use Ubuntu on your development machine,
it is likely that you have already installed this package.

Then you can use `$gcc --version` to make sure your GCC version is up-to-date.

<Warning>

Some Linux distributions ships outdated compilers in their package manager by default.
Be sure to install a relatively recent version.
