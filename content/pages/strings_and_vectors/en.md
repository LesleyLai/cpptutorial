title: "Strings and Vectors"
---

Up until now, most of the programming examples you have seen manipulate single numerical values.

This chapter introduces some of the most commonly used types in C++, the `string` and `vector`.
A `string` is a convenient abstraction over a sequence of characters.
and a `vector` represents a generic sequence of things.
Having those libraries in your toolbox will make your life much easier to write interesting applications.
