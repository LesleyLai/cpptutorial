title: "Control Flow"
---

Deciding run a piece of code conditionally by `if` or
running a piece of code repeatedly through loops is the basic building block of
the most structured programming languages.
C++ provides several facilities for control flows.
You are probably already familiar with those constructs from other languages,
and this section will show you the C++ syntax.

## Branching with `if` statement

The `if` statement enables you to execute some part of the code conditionally.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto main() -> int {
  int x = 1;
  if (x < 5) {
    std::cout << "The condition is met.\n";
  }
  std::cout << "Goodbye\n";
}
```

The above program should print the lines `The condition is met` and `Goodbye`.
If you change `x` to `6`, only `Goodbye` will be printed.

You can have an optional `else` branch:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto main() -> int {
  int x = 1;
  if (x < 5) {
    std::cout << "The condition is met.\n";
  } else {
    std::cout << "The condition is not met.\n";
  }
  std::cout << "Good bye\n";
}
```

Furthermore, you can chain multiple `if-else` statements together to handle multiple conditions.
For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto main() -> int {
  int x = 6;
  if (x % 2 == 0) {
    std::cout << "x is divisible by 2\n";
  } else if (x % 3 == 0) {
    std::cout << "x is divisible by 3\n";
  } else if (x % 5 == 0) {
    std::cout << "x is divisible by 5\n";
  } else {
    std::cout << "x is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5\n";
  }
}
```

Try to change the value of `x` to `1`, `3`, `5`, and `10`,
and see if the result is what you expected.

## Iterative process

You may come from a programming language with no dedicated iterative (looping) constructs
to operate repeatedly.
In those languages,
the primary method to implement iteration is recursion.
You can do the same thing in C++.

Here is an example of using recursion to calculate
the [*greatest common divisor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)
for two integers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto gcd(int a, int b) -> int
{
  if (a == 0) {
      return b;
  }
  
  return gcd(b % a, a);
}

auto main() -> int {
  std::cout << "gcd(3, 5) = " << gcd(3, 5) << '\n'; // 1
  std::cout << "gcd(35, 15) = " << gcd(35, 15) << '\n'; // 5
}
```

<Info>

Writing `gcd` ourselves is a decent exercise.
On the other hand, the C++ standard library `<numeric>` header already provides an `std::gcd` function.

</Info>

Using recursion as an iterative process has a lot of problems.
It is harder to understand a complicated recursive function then more dedicated constructs;
also, without carefully constructs the recursion to be *tail-recursive*,
each recursive calls will allocate some memory on the *call stack* and
it blows-up the stack pretty quickly.

<Info>

Worse, the C++ standard does not guarantee the tail call optimization.
Even though all the major C++ compilers implement this optimization,
it is not performed when the optimization level is zero (what "debug build" usually does.)

</Info>

C++ and many other imperative languages
use loops as the standard way to represent iteration processes.
C++ provides while loops, for loops, and range-based for loops.
We cover while and for loops here,
and the range-based for loop in the next chapter when we introduce containers.

### while loop

The while loop is one of the many ways C++ provides to repeat an operation.
The syntax is `while (condition) body`.

The while loop checks the condition before entering the loop.
If the condition is false, the body will never be executed.
After acting each time, 
while rechecks the condition to see if the loop needs to continue.

Below is the implementation of function `gcd` using the while loop:

```cpp
#include <utility>

auto gcd(int a, int b) -> int
{
  while (a != 0) {
    b = std::exchange(a, b % a);
  }
  return b;
}
```

In the above snippet,
I used a standard library function `std::exchange`,
which replaces the value of `a` with `b % a` and returns the old value of `a`.
Without the standard library function,
we need to write the following:

```cpp
auto gcd(int a, int b) -> int
{
  while (a != 0) {
-    b = std::exchange(a, b % a);
+    int temp = b % a;
+    b = a;
+    a = temp;
  }
  return b;
}
```

<Info>

It is a recurrent theme in C++ where we use the standard library facilities
to implement dedicated language features in other languages.
If you are familiar with the Python programming language,
you may know the tuple unpacking feature, which lets you write code such as `a, b = b, b % a`.
C++ does not provide this language feature, but we can use the standard library to express it.

</Info>

There is also a more rarely seen constructs called do-while loop,
which operates at least once and then check the condition.
The syntax is `do body while(condition);`.

For example,
the following function will print at least one number
even if you pass a large number such as 100.

```cpp
void print_numbers(int n) {
  do {
    std::cout << n << '\n';
    ++n;
  } while (n < 10);
}
```

### Break statement

You can early exit the loop by a break statement.
For example, the above do while example can also be implemented
by a regular while loop and a `break`:

```cpp
void print_numbers(int n) {
  while(true) {
    std::cout << n << '\n';
    ++n;
    if (n >= 10) break;
  }
}
```

### For loop

The for loop is similar to while loop in term of the purpose
â€” to perform an operation over and over again.
For example, the below snippet prints the integers from 0 to 9.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
  std::cout << i << '\n';
}
```

The syntax is a bit more complicated than the while loop, as there are three parts in the parentheses.
The three parts are separated by semicolumns`;`.
The `int i = 0` part is the *initializer*
which initializes the variable `i`; `i` is only in scope inside the for loop.
The `i < 10` part is the condition similar to the condition of the while loop.
And the `++i` part is the *loop expression*, which runs each iteration after the loop body's execution.

If you are performing an operation based on a count or an index,
for loop express your intention clearer than the `while` loop.
For example,
the while loop counterpart of the above for loop is

```cpp
{
  int i = 0;
  while (i < 10) {
    std::cout << i << '\n';
    ++i;
  }
}
```

<Info>

Notice the explicit curly braces here since I want to restrict the scope of the variable `i`.

</Info>

### Continue statement

When a continue statement is encountered inside a loop,
the control jumps to the start of the next iteration of the loop,
and skip the execution of the remaining body of the current iteration.
Continue can be a useful device to skip some iteration of a loop.
The below snippet print integers from 0 to 9, excluding 5.

```cpp
void print_numbers_no_5(int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    if (i == 5) continue;
    std::cout << i << '\n';
  }
}
```

## Ternary expressions

In expression-oriented programming languages such as ML or Rust,
you can write "if-expression" and get the result as a value.
`if` is not an expression in C++,
but the same thing is achieved by the ternary expression.

The syntax of a ternary expression is `condition ? truecase : falsecase`;
if the condition is true, the true case get evaluated as the result,
otherwise, the false case gets evaluated.

For example, say you have a function that returns "even" for even numbers and "odd" for add numbers:

```cpp
auto is_even_string(int n) -> std::string {
  if (n % 2 == 0) {
      return "even";
  } else {
      return "odd";
  }
}
```

`std::string` is the C++ way to represent a string of characters.
To use it, you need to `#include <string>`.
We will talk about it extensively in the next chapter.

Using ternary expression, you can write:

```cpp
auto is_even_string(int n) -> std::string {
  return n % 2 == 0 ? "even" : "odd";
}
```

You can nest ternary expression, just like how you use other expressions.
For example, the classic "Fizzbuzz" game can be implemented as:

```cpp
auto fizzbuzz(int n) -> std::string {
  return
    (n % 15 == 0) ? "FizzBuzz" :
    (n % 3 == 0) ? "Fizz" :
    (n % 5 == 0) ? "Buzz" :
    std::to_string(n);
}
```
