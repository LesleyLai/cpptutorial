title: "Language Basics"
---

Chapter 1 shows basic constructs that appear in almost every programming language.
None of the concepts presented here are unique to C++ (though C++ did pioneer some of them.)

Specifically, we will talk about fundamental types, variables, functions, and control flows.
Those constructs are likely familiar to you if you come from any other imperative programming language.
We will also dabble on some of C++'s more unique features, such as `const`.
Don't be afraid of those new concepts. Maybe you can make them your new friends. Who knows?
