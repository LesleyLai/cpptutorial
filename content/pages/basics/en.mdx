title: "Language Basics"
---

Chapter 1 shows basic constructs that appear in almost every programming language. None of the concepts presented here are unique to C++ (though C++ did invent some of them.)  We discuss them in the context of C++. Specifically, we will talk about variables, functions, and control flows. Those constructs are likely familiar to you if you come from any other imperative programming language. We will also dabble on some of C++'s more unique features, including template and `const`. Don't be afraid of those new concepts. Who knows? Maybe you can make them your new friends.
