C++ provides almost the same set of the operators that you have seen

## Arithmatics

They also follow the precedence you expect

There are some handy shortcut for arithmatic operators such as `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`
that combines an infix binary with assignment. For example, `x = x + 42;` can be simplified to `x += 42;`.

There are also integer increment/decrement operators `++` and `--`.

Todo clarify: postfix/prefix
In most cases, using postfix and prefix does not matter.

There are no exponential operator in C++. TODO: expand a little bit
