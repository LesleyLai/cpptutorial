title: "Constants"
---

C++ provides two distinct features for immutable variables.

- `constexpr` means "this value is evaluated at compile time." It is a shorthand for the term "constant expression." It is used for specific constants in a program.
- `const` roughly means "I promise not to mutate this value later." The value of a `const` variable can be evaluated at runtime.

If you want to create some "global constant," it is very likely that you need `constexpr`. For example:
