title: "Variables and Scopes"
---

Variables associate a *value* with a name.
They are perhaps the most basic idea in programming.
Without variables,
there is no way to store a piece of information and extract them later,
and the expression power of a programming language would be severely degraded.

C++ is *statically-typed*,
which means that a variable can only hold one particular type during its lifetime.
For example, if a variable hold an integer, you cannot change it to hold a string later.

As a consequence, when you declare a variable, you must supply a type to the compiler.
For example,

```cpp
int x;
```

declare an integer `x`.

If you come from a language where you can put an integer to a variable and later assign a string to it,
then those languages are said to be *dynamically-typed*.
The static typing sounds constrictive,
but throughout the tutorial we will show you how the static *type system* can save us from a lot of trouble.
furthermore, a lot of optimizations are only possible because of static typing,
so static-typed languages such as C++ and Java tend to be faster than dynamically-typed languages.

Define

```cpp
int x = 42;
```

## Type inference with `auto`

When we define a variable from a expression with known type,
the compiler is smart enough to *infer* the type of that variable.

```cpp
-int x = 42;
+auto x = 42;
```

The usage of `auto` above does not have much advantage,
but there are cases where using explicit type is either annoying or even impossible.

## Scopes

TODO

<Info>

Different programming languages have vastly different opinions on variable shadowing.
Some languages, for example, [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), ban all forms of variable shadowing.
Other languages, such as [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
allow more form of variable shadowing than most languages do.
The C++ language allows you to use name shadowing,
but it is generally frowned upon,
and compilers and linters may warn you about it.
