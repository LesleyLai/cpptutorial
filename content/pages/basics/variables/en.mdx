title: "Variables and Scopes"

Variables associate a *value* with a name.
They are perhaps the most basic idea in programming.
Without variables,
there is no way to store a piece of information and extract them later,
and the expression power of a programming language would be severely degraded.

Each variable has a *type*, such as `int`.
The type specifies the set of valid values allowed for the variable, restricts supported operations, and provides semantic meaning for the underlying value.

## Variable declaration and definition

C++ is *statically-typed*,
which means that a variable can only hold one particular type during its lifetime.
For example, if a variable holds an integer, you cannot change it to store a string later.

Consequently, when you *declare* a variable, you need to supply a type to the compiler.
A declaration in C++ introduces the variable and specifies its meaning and properties.
For example, the following code declares an integer `x`.

```cpp
int x;
```

If you come from a language where you can put an integer to a variable and later assign a string to it,
then those languages are said to be *dynamically-typed*.
The static typing sounds constrictive,
but we will show you how the static *type system* can save us from troubles throughout the tutorial.
Furthermore, a lot of optimizations are only possible because of static typing,
so static-typed languages such as C++ and Java tend to be faster than dynamically-typed languages.

Some variable declarations in C++ also allocate storage,
we call those declarations *definition*.
We can initialize variables in their definition.
For example, the following snippet initializes the `x` with value `42`.

```cpp
int x = 42;
```

It is usually a good idea to initialize variables.

A variable can be declared an arbitrary number of times,
but it can only be defined once.
This rule is called the *One-Definition Rule*.

We can declare a variable without defining them by the `extern` keyword, which indicates that the variable will be defined somewhere else.

```cpp
extern int x; // declaration
std::cout << x; // we can used the variable even with only declaration

...

int x = 42; // actual definition can be somewhere else
```

Using the `extern` keyword is not a very common practice in C++,
but it is useful when we need to define a variable in a separate source file.

## Type inference with `auto`

When we define a variable from an expression with a known type,
the compiler can *infer* the type of that variable.

```cpp
-int x = 42;
+auto x = 42;
```

The usage of `auto` above does not have much advantage,
but there are cases where using explicit type is either annoying or even impossible.

The static-type property of C++ is still maintained when using `auto`. The C++ compiler sees the value `42` and infers that `x` is an `int`. In fact, `int x = 42` and `auto x = 42` does exact the same thing.

As implied, it is impossible to use `auto` when we do not initialize a variable:

Todo: bug icon
```cpp
auto x;
```

## Scopes

Every variable in C++ lives in some *scope*.
In C++, a *block* (delimited by `{ }`) is a primary way to introduce a scope.
Variables in a block have the scope that extends from their declaration to the end of a block.

You can only use a variable when it is in the scope. For example:

```cpp
auto main() -> int
{
  std::cout << x; // Error: x is out of scope
  {
    std::cout << x; // Error x is out of scope
    int x = 42;
    std::cout << x; // Ok, 42
  }
  std::cout << x; // Error x is out of scope
}
```

You can declare a variable in the inner scope with the same name as another variable in the outer scope,
this mechanism is called *variable shadowing*.
When variable shadowing occurs,
the compiler will always pick the variable available in the most inner scope.

```cpp
auto main() -> int
{
  int x = 5;
  std::cout << x; // 5
  {
    int x = 10;
    std::cout << x; // 10
    x = 11;
    std::cout << x; // 11
  }
  std::cout << x; // 5
}
```

<Info>

Different programming languages have vastly different opinions on variable shadowing.
Some languages, for example, [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), ban all forms of shadowing.
Other languages, such as [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
allow more form of variable than most languages do.
The C++ language allows you to use shadowing in a limited degree,
but compilers and linters may warn you about it.
