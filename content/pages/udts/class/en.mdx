title: "Access Control, Constructors, and Classes"
---

So far, we are able to define "plain structures" and define separate functions for them.
Having "dumb data" separates from operations has its merit since
We can use data in an arbitrary way.
However, sometimes a tighter connection between the data representation and operations is beneficial.
In particular, we want to keep the data representation from the user of a type from time to time.
This kind of **encapsulation** can make our types safer,
easier to use and make it possible for us to extend or modify the underlying data representation in the future.
To achieve these, we need to distinguish between the interface (which can be used in everywhere) of a type and its implementation (which is hidden and can only be used as internals). 

One of the most important ways to achieve encapsulation in C++ is public/private accessing control.
We put the interface as the `public` members of a structure, and the implementation becomes private members.

```cpp
struct Temperature {
    double kelvin = 0;
};
```

Breaking:

```cpp
Temperature t;
t.kelvin = -1; // oops
```

## Access Control

```cpp
struct Temperature {
private:
    double kelvin_ = 0;
public:
    auto kelvin() const -> double {
        return kelvin_;
    }

    void set_kelvin(double new_kelvin) {
        if (new_kelvin < 0) new_kelvin = 0;
        kelvin_ = new_kelvin;
    }
};
```

## Constructors

## Keyword `class`

C++  has another keyword for user defined types, `class`.
Unlike a lot of other programming languages, `struct` and `class` creates the same kind of types.
They can both have constructors, and access control specifiers.
The only difference is that in `class`,
visibility of every members is `private` by default.

For example: TODO

`struct` and `class` can always be used interchangably with minor modification.
However they do communicate meaning to humans.
I prefer to use the `struct` keyword on data with no business logic and invariant,
and to use `class` on more complicated types.
