title: "Access Control, Constructors, and Classes"
---

So far, we are able to define "plain structures" and define separate functions for them.
Having "dumb data" separates from operations has its merit since
We can use data in an arbitrary way.
However, sometimes a tighter connection between the data representation and operations is beneficial.
In particular, we want to keep the data representation from the user of a type from time to time.
This kind of **encapsulation** can make our types safer,
easier to use and make it possible for us to extend or modify the underlying data representation in the future.
To achieve these, we need to distinguish between the interface (which can be used in everywhere) of a type and its implementation (which is hidden and can only be used as internals). 

One of the most important ways to achieve encapsulation in C++ is public/private accessing control.
We put the interface as the `public` members of a structure, and the implementation becomes private members.


In the following example, we try to define a type that represents a unit vector.
Its data representation is cartesian coordinate `x`, `y`, and `z`,
but that is not the end of the story. Our type has a constraint where its length ($x^2 + y^2 + z^2$) is equal to 1.
And we call this kind of constraint *invariant*.

```cpp
struct UnitVector {
  double x;
  double y;
  double z;
};
```

To maintain the invariant of this type, we need to create dedicated functions to operate on it.
For example, if we want to create a unit vector from an arbitrary coordinate, we must normalize the result;
otherwise, it would not be a unit vector.

TODO: an illustration

```cpp
auto create_unit_vector(double x, double y, double z) -> UnitVector {
  auto length = std::sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);
  return {.x = x / length, .y = y / length, .z = z / length};
}
```

And we cannot use the `UnitVector` freely.
For example, we can't initialize unit vectors on our own or modify its data member directly,
even though nothing will prevent us from doing it.

```cpp
UnitVector v1 {1, 2, 3}; // oops

auto v2 = create_unit_vector(1, 2, 3);
v2.x = 2; // oops
```

It is unlikely for anyone to write code as preposterous as above.
However, it is easy to make mistakes when the program gets more complex,
especially when you are not the original author as a type and do not have a solid grasp on its implementation.
Still, since we don't have anything to prevent invariant violations,
we need to rely on comments to caution our future selves and other people:

```cpp
// Warning: do not ever create UnitVector or mutate its x/y/z value directly!
// Always use it with dedicated functions!
```

Unfortunately, we programmers are terrible at reading comments.

## Constructors

## Access Control

## Keyword `class`

C++ has another keyword for user defined types, `class`.
Unlike a lot of other programming languages, `struct` and `class` defines the same kind of types in C++.
They can both have constructors, and access control specifiers.
The only difference is that in `class`,
visibility of every members is `private` by default.

For example: TODO

`struct` and `class` can always be used interchangably with minor modification.
However they do communicate meaning to humans.
I prefer to use the `struct` keyword on data with no business logic and invariant,
and to use `class` on more complicated types.
