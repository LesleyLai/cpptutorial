title: "User-Defined Types"
---

C++ provides a small set of fundamental types, such as `int` and `double`.
Those types are low-level and directly represent the capabilities of traditional hardware.
However, they don't provide programmers with enough facilities for writing large-scale software.

The C++ language provides mechanisms to let programmers compose and abstract existing data types.
With those facilities, programmers can design and implement their own types and add useful operations and semantics to those types.

The `std::string` and `std::vector` types we encountered earlier are examples of such **user-defined types**,
though the standard library provides them.
In principle, a programmer can also write their own string and vector types in C++ that achieve the same functionalities as those standard library counterparts.

The rest of this chapter describes some of those facilities to define and use types.
And we will pick up more advanced features and usage patterns in later chapters.
