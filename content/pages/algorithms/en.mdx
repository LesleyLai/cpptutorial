Consider the following piece of code:

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <span>

void move_zeros(std::span<int> nums) {
  std::size_t last_non_zero_index = 0;
  for (std::size_t i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
    if (nums[i] != 0) {
      nums[last_non_zero_index++] = nums[i];
    }
  }
  std::memset(&nums[last_non_zero_index], 0,
              sizeof(int) * (nums.size()-last_non_zero_index));
}
```

It moves all the zeros in a `span` to its end.
However, if you find the above code a bit more intimidating than the simple task it is trying to perform,
you are not alone. Consider our loop:
```cpp
std::size_t last_non_zero_index = 0;
for (std::size_t i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
  if (nums[i] != 0) {
    nums[last_non_zero_index++] = nums[i];
  }
}
```

Although the intuitive understanding of that loop is just "shifting all non-zero elements up,"
the way that the code is written is
"for each number `i` from zero until the size of `num`,
if the `i`-th element is not zero,
move it to the `last_non_zero_index`-th element,
and then increase `last_non_zero_index`."

There are two reasons that this loop is harder to understand than it should.
First, it feels very mechanical.
Our intuitive understanding of the process is simple,
yet the code is step-by-step instructions on manipulating the elements.
Second, the code *mutates* the value of `last_non_zero_index` inside the loop,
which means we need to reason its value step-by-step in our head.
All things considered, it is hard to understand the loop as a whole without tracing its execution by steps.

Now consider the following program that performs the same operation:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <span>

void move_zeros(std::span<int> nums) {
  const auto last_non_zero = std::remove(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
  std::fill(last_non_zero, nums.end(), 0);
}
```

This version uses the standard library algorithms `remove` and `fill`.
It is significantly shorter, directly expresses our intent, and can also be easily parallelized.
This chapter will enable you to understand and write code in style empowered by standard algorithms.

## Simplicity vs familiarity

If you feel that the first snippet is more straightforward, you are also certainly not alone.
Sometimes it is hard to see whether a pattern is simple or not when we spend enough time with it.

I hope this chapter can at least get you familiar with the standard algorithms,
and it is up to you to make educated decisions on when to use them.
