title: "Welcome to the C++ Tutorial"
---

Welcome to the new working-in-progress C++ tutorial,
a fast-paced introduction to C++ for experienced developers coming from other languages.

Ideally, you should already have a solid understanding of another programming language to benefit from this tutorial. At the minimum, you should already understand the basic programming concepts, such as variables, control flows, and functions.
Nevertheless, we will cover how to express those concepts in C++ in Chapter 1.

The tutorial is built in a linear fashion such that it does not refer to new concept not introduced previously.
We will also introduce tools and best practices along the way.

The code examples in the tutorial focus on approachability for beginners.
As a result, sometimes, we intentionally choose not to write the most efficient, elegant, and idiomatic C++ code possible.
However, with the tutorial introduces more C++ into your toolbox, the code used by the tutorial will start to converge into what a seasoned C++ developer will write.

Notice that this tutorial is in its very early stage. Thus, everything, including the table of contents, is subject to change.
