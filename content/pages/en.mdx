title: "Welcome to the C++ Tutorial"
---

Welcome to cpptutorial.org. This tutorial targets experienced programmers with limited C++ background. Maybe you took your college data structure course in C++ and forget about it; Maybe you want a transition into C++; Or maybe you are like me, who learn new programming languages for fun. On the other hand, if you are new to programming in general, this tutorial may not fit for you.

You should already understand the basic programming concepts, including variables, control flows, and functions. This tutorial, however, walks through how to express those concepts in C++ in chapter 1.

The tutorial is built in a linear fashion such that it does not refer to concepts or language constructs not introduced previously.
Tools and best practices will be introduced along the way.
And each chapters will end with a small coding project to get your hand dirty.
If you already have some C++ background, feel free to skip sections and projects.

Notice that this tutorial is in its very early stage. Thus, everything, including the table of contents, is subject to change.
