`std::remove` *shifts* elements that **are not** equal to the provided value to the **beginning** of a range
 and leaves the remaining part of the range in an unspecified state.
It returns an iterator at the beginning of the "remaining part of the range".

This function will not shrink a container by itself,
but is often combined with containers' `.erase()` member function to remove elements from a container (*Eraseâ€“remove idiom*).

Example usage:

```cpp notip=true
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 1, 2, 1};
auto p = std::remove(std::begin(v), std::end(v), 1);
// v = { 2, 2, ?, ?, ? }
// p ----------^
v.erase(p, std::end(v));
// v = { 2, 2 }
```
