`a = exchange(b, c)` replaces the value of a with the value of `b`,
and replace the value of `b` with the value of `c`.

Example usage:

```cpp notip=true
auto fibonacci(int count) -> int {
    int a = 0, b = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
        a = std::exchange(b, a + b);
    }
    return a;
}
```
